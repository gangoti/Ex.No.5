# EXP 5: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROMPTING PATTERNS AND EXPLAIN WITH VARIOUS TEST SCENARIOS

# Aim: To test and compare how different pattern models respond to various prompts (broad or unstructured) versus basic prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios.  Analyze the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated responses 

### AI Tools Required: 

# Explanation: 
üß≠ Objective:

To evaluate and compare different prompting strategies in AI interactions using varied test scenarios, aiming to determine their effectiveness in generating accurate, relevant, and context-aware responses.

üî¨ Prompting Patterns Under Comparison:
Prompting Pattern	Description
Zero-Shot Prompting	No examples are provided. The model is asked to perform a task directly.
One-Shot Prompting	One example is provided to guide the model.
Few-Shot Prompting	A few examples are provided (typically 2‚Äì5) to demonstrate the task.
Chain-of-Thought Prompting	Prompts encourage the model to reason step-by-step before giving a final answer.
Role-Based Prompting	Prompt defines a specific role or persona for the model (e.g., "Act as a lawyer...").
Instruction-Based Prompting	A direct instruction is given without examples, often clearly formatted.
Self-Ask Prompting	The model is prompted to ask itself questions before answering.
‚öôÔ∏è Experimental Setup:
Independent Variable:

Prompting pattern used

Dependent Variables:

Accuracy

Completeness

Relevance

Reasoning quality

Efficiency (conciseness, clarity)

üìÇ Test Scenarios:

We evaluate each pattern using different task types:

‚úÖ Scenario 1: Factual Q&A

Task: "What is the capital of Brazil?"

‚úÖ Scenario 2: Text Classification

Task: "Classify the following review as Positive or Negative: 'The product broke after 1 day.'"

‚úÖ Scenario 3: Math Problem Solving

Task: "If a train travels 60 miles in 1.5 hours, what is its average speed?"

‚úÖ Scenario 4: Creative Writing

Task: "Write a short story about a lost dog that finds its way home."

‚úÖ Scenario 5: Coding Task

Task: "Write a Python function that returns the factorial of a number."


## Prompt:

Zero-Shot: "If a train travels 60 miles in 1.5 hours, what is its average speed?"

Prompt:

Chain-of-Thought: "If a train travels 60 miles in 1.5 hours, what is its average speed? Let's think step by step."
